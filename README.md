[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sagessylu/Chess.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sagessylu/Chess)  
![Python application](https://github.com/sagessylu/Chess/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)

This is a computer version of the chess game.
This is currently under progress, GUI will be added later.

It is currently lacking of :
- working check handling
- castlings and en passant captures
- game endings (checkmate...)
