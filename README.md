# Chess

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sagessylu/Chess.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sagessylu/Chess)  

This is a computer version of the chess game.
This is currently under progress, GUI will be added later.

To implement :
- castlings, en passant captures, pawn promotion
- game endings (checkmate...)
- GUI
- human vs. computer ???

I'm not sure whether I will implement human vs. computer at some point, because I don't know if I will be able to make it.
